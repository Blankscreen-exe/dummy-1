# Za Warudo

A humanoid Stand, The World is tall and has a very muscular build. It bears a striking resemblance to DIO in terms of appearance. It wears a headpiece covering its face to the end of its nose, slanting at a steep angle from the base of its forehead to a peak situated above the rear of its head by about half its height, leaving the face of an inverted triangle visible to the front; somewhat similar to the Red Crown of Lower Egypt.
