# My README file

> ðŸ“Œ This repository is part of a medum.com blog that I have written. See the blog [here](https://medium.com/@hammad.ai/manage-readme-md-with-github-actions-python-96222cb26b58?source=friends_link&sk=3ad305e1ed46d5ee226310d2bf4e4190).

This `README.md` file is auto written by Github Actions. The list below is a list of files you will see in the `docs/` directory.

- If any markdown file is **created** inside the `docs/` directory, a list item here in the `README.md` will automatically be added by using the `helpers/add_to_list.py` script.

- If any markdown file is **deleted** inside the `docs/` directory, the corresponding list item here in the `README.md` will automatically be removed by using the `helpers/delete_line.py` script.
